# Never Start another Website from Scratch again! #
With this website template, the basic files and tags every website needs are already included. Simply copy the templates and get to coding. 
## Instructions ##
Always code in the ```src``` directory. 
Make sure [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) is installed. Once that is done, simply begin editing and run ```gulp``` to transpile your ES6 javascript code, compile your sass code into css, and view live editing in your browser. See the compiled css and transpiled javascript files in the ```dist``` directory.
